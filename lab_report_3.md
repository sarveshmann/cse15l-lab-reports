2. Give two examples for each command-line option.

3. Cite the sources.


## **1: Choose a command to explore**

### `grep` Command:

I chose the command `grep` to explore. `grep` is used to perform a "filter-search" on a file to find particular words or characters in it. 
Its four command-line options that I will be exploring are as following:

*[Note: I have added smaller descriptions of each command-line options that makes them easy to remember]*

1. `-i`: (ignores case) this command-line options allows you to find **case-insensitive** matches of the pattern of given word or character.
2. `-n`: (numbers and lines) this command-line option outputs the lines and their numbers that match the pattern of given word or character.
3. `-c`: (count of lines) this command-line option outputs the number of lines that match the pattern of given word or character.
4. `-w`: (whole word) this command-line option allows you find the lines that match the given word or character precisely.
