## **1: Choose a command to explore**

### `grep` Command:

I chose the command `grep` to explore. `grep` is used to perform a "filter-search" on a file to find particular words or characters in it. 
Its four command-line options that I would be exploring are as following:

1. `-i`: this command-line options allows you to find case-sensitive matches of the pattern of given word or character.
2. `-n`: this command-line option outputs the lines that match the pattern of given word or character.
3. `-c`: this command-line option outputs the number of lines that match the pattern of given word or character.
4. `-w`: this command-line option allows you find the lines that match the given word or character precisely.
